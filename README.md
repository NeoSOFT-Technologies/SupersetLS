## About the project
SupersetLS - Superset Logstash Solr, is a containerized package of tools to view the realtime logs generated by an application on a dashboard powered by SuperSet. Solr is used to store the log data while Logstash is used to read the changes in a log file and push the new logs to the Solr for persistence. SuperSet is linked to Solr for reading the data and converting the data into charts for visualization.
